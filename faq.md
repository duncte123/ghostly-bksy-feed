# What is The Ghost Zone?

The Ghost Zone is a custom BlueSky feed containing posts about Danny Phantom related art, personalities, and culture.

# What are the rules?

- No NSFW, please.
  - Posts tagged #nsfw are excluded from the algorithm. Forgetting to tag NSFW content as such will result in immediate blacklisting from the feed.
- All images must have an alt text description!
- Automated accounts that post more frequently than every hour may be banned in order to avoid flooding the feed. I am willing to work with you if your account posts a lot of pertinent information and you are willing to provide aggregated posts for the feed to latch on to. Message me if this is the case.
- Accounts may be blacklisted from the feed at operator discretion. Be nice.

# What if I want my posts excluded from the feed?

Contact @im.going-g.host on BlueSky for account exclusions.
